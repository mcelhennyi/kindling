  End-to-end feature request: FR-NNNN registry, layered design, tickets + DAG,
  then optional /identify-frontier, /develop-frontier; /finish-feature only after
  docs/ai-context.md §2d feature-complete gate (or /finish-frontier). Resume with /feature-request-continue.

# /feature-request

Follow the Cursor project skill **`.cursor/skills/feature-request/SKILL.md`**.

## End every turn for the user

End each response with **Executive summary**, **Suggested next step**, and **Options** when more than one reasonable path exists — see **User-facing close (required)** and **`reference-templates.md` → User-facing session close** in that skill.

## Prerequisite (recommended)

When a **top-level design doc** under **`docs/design/`** already exists, run **`/audit-design <path>`** first; then **`/feature-request <same path>`** when verdict is **Ready** or accepted **Caution**.

## What this is

- **Not** a replacement for `identify-frontier` / `develop-frontier` / `finish-feature` / `finish-frontier`.
- A **product-sized** flow: **intake** → **interface-first design** (skeleton, then depth as needed) → **`20-tickets-dag.md`** (Jira/Asana-friendly markdown, Mermaid DAG) → **prompt** to implement → **`/develop-frontier`** when tickets (**`T-FR-NNNN-xx`**) are in the tracker → **prompt** to **`/finish-feature`** when **`docs/ai-context.md` §2d** **feature-complete gate** is met (or **`/finish-frontier`** if integrating straight to the default branch).
- For **large** features, use **subagents early** per **`docs/ai-context.md` §1b** (e.g. per subsystem design or codebase survey) before consolidating artifacts.
- **Parallel features:** several **`FR-NNNN`** may be in flight; each has its own **`tasks/feature-history/FR-…/`** directory. **`/develop-frontier`** still batches tickets (**`T-FR-NNNN-xx`**) from the **global** graph — see **`docs/ai-context.md` §2c** and **`tasks/ticket-progress.md` → Parallel streams**.
- **Human-readable naming:** In prompts, diaries, and handoffs, lead with each ticket’s **title** from **`tickets.md`**; use the **`T-FR-NNNN-xx`** id with a **link** to the canonical **`###`** section for detail (full rule in **`.cursor/skills/feature-request/SKILL.md` → Human-readable names vs ticket ids**).

## Compose with existing commands (do not fork behavior)

1. **Before develop:** land tickets (**`T-FR-NNNN-xx`**) in **`tasks/feature-history/FR-NNNN-<slug>/tickets.md`**, **`tasks/feature-history/TICKET-SOURCES.md`**, **`docs/design/tickets-initial.md`** (DAG index), and **`tasks/ticket-progress.md`** (or a PR-ready “Proposed patch” in `20-tickets-dag.md` if you cannot commit yet).
2. **Parallel handoff (optional, recommended):** `/identify-frontier`
3. **Implement:** `/develop-frontier` (feature worktree at **`.worktrees/FR-NNNN-<slug>/feature/`**; ticket/stage child worktrees under the same feature folder)
4. **Integrate:** `/finish-feature` after **§2d** gate (default branch PR) or `/finish-frontier` (direct default branch)

**Development commands:** during implementation, run build/test/lint/package-manager/doc/dev-server commands inside Docker / Docker Compose / Dev Container / CI images where possible. Use **`./develop run …`**, `docker compose run …`, or the configured Dev Container before host-local commands; document exceptions in feature diaries or handoffs.

**Doc site during design / VAL:** when **`docs/`** or **`mkdocs.yml`** change, use **`./develop help`** and run **`./develop up`** (Docker Compose) or **`./develop local`** (venv fallback; document why host-local was used); use **`./develop build`** for a static check. Optional **`develop.conf`**; see root **`README.md`** and **`.cursor/skills/feature-request/SKILL.md`** (local dev / Docker section).

## “Identify” disambiguation

- Spoken **identify (FR)** in the lifecycle = **register `FR-NNNN` + write intake** in `tasks/feature-history/`.
- `/identify-frontier` = **parallel tickets** (`T-FR-NNNN-xx`) from the ticket graph; run **only after** tickets exist.

## Artifacts and registry

- Allocate **`FR-NNNN`** in **`tasks/feature-history/REGISTRY.md`**; never reuse an id. **Push that registry change (and minimal feature stub) to `main` immediately** so concurrent features deconflict on a single source of truth.
- All stage notes in **`tasks/feature-history/FR-NNNN-<slug>/`**: `serial-diary.md` (serial), **`parallel/*.md`** (per parallel subagent), **`handoffs/*.md`** (continue / milestone / closeout — **canonical** for this feature), optional **`DIARY.md`** (merged newest-first stack). Closeout recap in **`90-closeout.md`**; optional short pointer in **`tasks/handoffs/`** only.
- **Repo-root `CURRENT.md`:** on **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`** and ticket branches under that feature, maintain **`CURRENT.md`** at the repository root as the branch-local “where we are” file; refresh through the lifecycle; remove it when merging to **`main`** (see **`.cursor/skills/feature-request/SKILL.md` → Branch state (`CURRENT.md`)**). On **`main`** during design-only work, prefer the feature **`README.md`** instead of a competing per-feature root file.
