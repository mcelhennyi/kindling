# Development standards

Use with **`docs/ai-context.md`**. This file mirrors Cursor-facing rules for Claude Code sessions.

**Documentation as source of truth** (design vs process, escalation tags): **`docs/ai-context.md`** and **`docs-authority-and-escalation.md`** (mirrors **`.cursor/rules/docs-authority-and-escalation.mdc`**).

## Code style

- **Stack-specific rules:** **`.cursor/rules/stack-conventions.mdc`** once the project chooses languages and frameworks.

## Comments and documentation

- Prefer short **file or module** notes that state **I/O contracts** (what goes to logs vs API responses; which stream or channel), **invariants**, and **security/privacy boundaries** (what must never be logged or sent), and that point to **`docs/design/...`** where behavior is specified.
- Use the traceability prefix defined in **`docs/design/documentation-style.md`** (default pattern **`@PROJ-<AREA>-<NUMBER>`** until customized).
- **What to comment:** **why** something is done a non-obvious way; **preconditions, errors, and threading** for public APIs or process boundaries; **stubs and temporary** behavior, with **DESIGN-GAP** or a ticket reference when design is incomplete.
- **What to skip:** comments that only narrate the next line in English; JSDoc that duplicates an obvious function name with no new information.
- **Claude / Cursor / humans:** the same bar applies — explanatory, not noise.

## Tie backs to documentation

- Escalation tags (**DESIGN-GAP**, **DESIGN-FLAW**, **CODE-DEFECT**) follow **`docs/ai-context.md`**.

## Testing environment

- Run development-specific commands (**build**, **test**, **lint**, **format**, generators, package-manager scripts, doc builds, and dev servers) inside Docker / Docker Compose / Dev Container / CI images where possible.
- Prefer repo wrappers such as **`./develop`**, `docker compose run`, or the configured Dev Container before host-local execution.
- When a container path is unavailable, host-local commands are allowed only as documented exceptions in the ticket diary / handoff, with a follow-up to add container support when appropriate.
- Run verification (**VAL**) in the containerized environment tickets specify.

## Worktrees and session beacon

- Store local git worktrees under **`.worktrees/`**.
- Each feature uses **`.worktrees/FR-NNNN-<slug>/feature/`** on **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`**.
- Each implementation ticket or stage uses a child worktree under that feature folder on a feature-prefixed branch such as **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>/T-FR-NNNN-xx-short-name`**.
- Keep **`tasks/ticket-progress.md` → Current focus** updated (**Active ticket**, **Branch / worktree**, **Session status**).

## Subagents (large work)

- **Ahead of large work:** Prefer delegation before broad exploration or multi-file refactors. Follow **`docs/ai-context.md` §1b**.
- **Per ticket:** **TEST → DEV → VAL** serially in **one** worktree unless the team directs otherwise.
- **Parallel tickets:** **`/develop-frontier`** — one subagent per **ticket id**; then **`/finish-feature`** (per **`FR-NNNN`**, **`docs/ai-context.md` §2d**; **mandatory closeout** when gate passes) or **`/finish-frontier`** as the team chose.

## Feature request and frontier (compose)

- **`/feature-request`** / **`.cursor/skills/feature-request/SKILL.md`** — **`FR-NNNN`** design and **`tickets.md`**; does **not** replace **`/identify-frontier`** / **`/develop-frontier`** / **`/finish-feature`** / **`/finish-frontier`**.
- **Repo-root `CURRENT.md`:** on **`feat/*`** implementation branches, keep **`CURRENT.md`** current per that skill; remove on **`main`** when integrated.
- **User-facing close (FR work):** end substantive replies with **Executive summary**, **Suggested next step**, and **Options** when multiple paths apply — **`feature-request`** skill **User-facing close (required)**.
- **Spoken “identify (FR)”** = registry + intake; **`/identify-frontier`** = parallel **tickets** only **after** canonical **`### T-FR-NNNN-xx`** sections exist.
- **Registry races:** push **`REGISTRY.md`** + minimal stub to **`main` immediately** after allocating **`FR-NNNN`** (**`docs/ai-context.md` §2b**).

## Ticket completion

- When **VAL** is `done`, run **commit → push → PR** per team policy.
- Update **`docs/design/tickets-initial.md`** when your process marks triads complete.
- Optional metrics footer: **`/commit-with-metrics`** — **`.cursor/skills/commit-with-ai-metrics/SKILL.md`**.

## Session end

- Leave **`tasks/ticket-progress.md`** truthful for the next contributor.
