  Identifies the dependency-valid parallel ticket set, launches one subagent per

# Develop frontier

End-to-end: **discover** parallel-capable tickets, ensure each owning feature has a feature worktree, then run **one subagent per ticket** (separate child git worktree + feature-prefixed branch), **TEST → DEV → VAL** serially inside each ticket, then merge ticket work into each **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`**, validate, and push **those feature branches**. Run **`finish-feature`** (feature branch → PR to the default branch + **mandatory closeout**) **only** when **`docs/ai-context.md` §2d** **feature-complete gate** is met for that **`FR-NNNN`**; otherwise continue with **`/identify-frontier`** / the next wave. Use **`finish-frontier`** only when merging straight to the default branch per policy.

## Preconditions

- Load **`docs/ai-context.md`** (worktrees, ticket completion, **§1b subagents ahead of large work**).
- Integration checkout on **`main`** available for merges.
- For feature-branch work, each owning feature branch **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`** exists in **`.worktrees/FR-NNNN-<slug>/feature/`** (create it from `main` before launching ticket branches if needed).
- **Parent session:** stay thin — **one subagent per ticket** (**`T-FR-NNNN-xx`**) implements it; the orchestrator merges to **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`** and runs **`finish-feature`** (default-branch PR) **only** when **§2d** **feature-complete gate** is met, or runs **`finish-frontier`** when integrating straight to the default branch, per **`docs/ai-context.md` §1b**, **§2**, and **§2d**.
- **Development commands:** inside each ticket worktree, run build/test/lint/package-manager/dev-server/doc-build commands through Docker / Docker Compose / Dev Container / CI images where possible (for example **`./develop run …`**, `docker compose run …`, or the configured Dev Container). Host-local commands are exceptions and must be noted in the ticket diary or handoff.
- **Web UI validation:** any frontier ticket that creates or changes user-visible web UI must satisfy **`docs/ai-context.md` → Web UI validation** before **VAL** is marked `done`: scripted frontend checks plus rendered browser inspection using the project’s documented commands, local URL, browser-capable tool, and route/state matrix.

## 0 — Sync the skeleton, then refresh the frontier

Run this gate before the first wave and repeat it before every later wave. A
wave must not launch from stale skeleton guidance or template files.

1. In a clean integration worktree based on the current remote default branch,
   run **`./sync-skeleton`** (or
   **`bash .skeleton/scripts/sync-skeleton.sh`** when the wrapper is absent).
   Never overwrite a dirty checkout; use a separate clean worktree or stop.
2. Read **`.skeleton/CHANGELOG.md`** and apply required consumer-manual updates.
   Review and validate all staged changes. If the sync changed anything, commit
   and push the sync to the remote default branch using project policy before
   continuing.
3. Ensure every feature integration branch that may own a ticket in this wave
   contains that landed skeleton-sync commit before creating child ticket
   worktrees. Prefer merging the updated default branch; do not rewrite shared
   feature history unless project policy explicitly allows it.
4. Re-read this skill from the refreshed project files, then follow
   **`identify-frontier`** or read the latest
   **`tasks/handoffs/*-parallel-frontier.md`**.
5. If the parallel set is **empty**, stop and report.
6. Remember the set is **global** across all tickets — it may span **multiple
   `FR-NNNN`** features. Each subagent still owns **one ticket** and **one child
   worktree** under its owning feature folder, so mixed-feature batches stay
   clear (`docs/ai-context.md` §2c).

If the skeleton update, changelog reconciliation, validation, commit, push, or
feature-branch refresh cannot complete cleanly, record it as the current
blocker and stop before launching the wave.

## 1 — Orchestrator setup

1. Set **`tasks/ticket-progress.md` → Current focus** so multi-ticket work is visible (**Session status** `developing`, **Next agent should** lists frontier tickets, branches, and **`.worktrees/FR-NNNN-<slug>/...`** paths).

## 2 — Launch one subagent per frontier ticket (parallel)

Each subagent prompt must include:

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Ticket** | **`T-FR-NNNN-xx`**, title from the owning **`tasks/feature-history/FR-NNNN-<slug>/tickets.md`**. |
| **Worktree** | Feature branch at **`.worktrees/FR-NNNN-<slug>/feature/`**. Ticket/stage work in **`.worktrees/FR-NNNN-<slug>/T-FR-NNNN-xx-short-name/`**, branch e.g. **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>/T-FR-NNNN-xx-short-name`**, created from the feature branch. All phases **only** here. |
| **Phase order** | **TEST → DEV → VAL** serially for that ticket (per section in that ticket’s **`tickets.md`**). |
| **Validation** | Run ticket verification per **`docs/ai-context.md`** using Docker / Docker Compose / Dev Container / CI images where possible; for web UI tickets, include required scripted frontend checks plus rendered browser inspection. Document any host-local or browser-tool exception. |
| **Progress** | Update **only** that ticket’s row in **`tasks/ticket-progress.md`**. |
| **Completion** | VAL done → update DAG in **`docs/design/tickets-initial.md`** → commit → push → open **PR** whose **base** is **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`** when using the **feature-branch workflow** (§2d), otherwise base **`main`** per **`docs/ai-context.md` §7**. |
| **Branch state** | Create or refresh repo-root **`CURRENT.md`** on the ticket branch at stream start, after each phase (**TEST / DEV / VAL**), and before push/PR; parent updates **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`**’s **`CURRENT.md`** after merges — **`feature-request`** skill **Branch state (`CURRENT.md`)**. |

## 3 — Wait and verify

All frontier tickets **VAL** = `done`, branches **pushed**.

## 4 — Finish integration

- **Feature-branch workflow (preferred for `FR-NNNN` work):** merge completed ticket/stage branches into **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`**, revalidate, push **that feature branch**. Call **`finish-feature`** only when **§2d** **feature-complete gate** is met (then open a PR from **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`** to the default branch and run **closeout** per **`finish-feature`** skill §5). **Do not** open that PR for partial feature delivery. **No** automatic push to the default branch.
- **Direct-to-main frontier:** follow **`finish-frontier`** when integrating parallel tickets straight into the default branch per existing policy.

Important gate from **`finish-frontier`**: after merge conflict resolution (including `triadDone` union), integration must revalidate all requirements/tests before any push to `main`.

- If revalidation passes, continue normally.
- If revalidation fails, create/update a blocker as the **primary ticket** in `tasks/ticket-progress.md`, set `Session status` to `blocked`, push integration state to `broken-main`, and stop. Do not run `develop-frontier` again until that blocker ticket reaches VAL `done`.

## 5 — After integration is green

- Clear or advance **Current focus**.
- **Remote branches:** do **not** auto-delete **`feat/*`** ticket or feature branches — audit trail (**`finish-frontier`** / **`finish-feature`**).
- **Local worktrees:** optional remove only when remotes remain and paths are obsolete.
- **User-facing response:** the orchestrator’s reply to the user ends with **Executive summary**, **Suggested next step**, and **Options** if several paths are reasonable — **`feature-request`** skill **User-facing close (required)**.
