# Feature request (design → tickets → optional frontier)

Orchestrates a **markdown-first** feature lifecycle that feeds the repo’s
**parallel ticket frontier** tools. Composes with existing project commands —
does **not** replace them.

## Prerequisite (recommended)

When implementation will be driven by an existing **top-level design doc** under
**`docs/design/`**, run **`/audit-design <path>`** first. Use its verdict
(**Ready** / **Caution** / **Blocked**) and **Fix before tickets** list to
close gaps; then start this skill with the **same** design path. Skip audit only
for greenfield features with no design doc yet.

## User-facing close (required)

Every time work on this workflow **pauses for the human**—after a **stage**, a **checkpoint**, **ticket or design work**, **develop / finish** steps, **`/feature-request-continue`**, or **closeout**—end the reply with a compact block (template in **`reference-templates.md` → User-facing session close**):

1. **Executive summary** — what happened (decisions, files and tickets touched, branch or registry state). Use **ticket titles** with linked **`T-FR-NNNN-xx`** ids per **Human-readable names vs ticket ids** below.
2. **Suggested next step** — one primary recommendation (concrete command, ticket to open, or owner action).
3. **Options (when applicable)** — if more than one reasonable path exists, list them (**A**, **B**, …) with a short differentiator ( deps, risk, or time). If only one path is sensible, state that briefly or omit this part.

**Repo alignment:** when you write **`handoffs/`**, **`serial-diary.md`**, **`parallel/…`**, or **`90-closeout.md`**, include the same three elements so the **chat** and the **tree** do not disagree.

**Scope:** skip the full block only for **non-FR** one-offs (e.g. a one-line fix unrelated to the feature); any work under **`FR-NNNN`** still gets at least a one-line summary + next step.

## Related local commands (compose, do not fork)

| Step | Command / skill | Role |
|------|------------------|------|
| Pre-ticket design readiness (optional) | `audit-design` / `/audit-design` | Plain-English audit of a top-level **`docs/design/…`** doc before registering **`FR-NNNN`** — **`.cursor/skills/audit-design/SKILL.md`**. |
| Same-feature expansion | `expand-feature` / `/expand-feature` | Adds a sub-feature/change to an existing **`FR-NNNN`** with process scaled to the ask: simple UI worktree + docs HTML mock, or **`30-expand-*`** addendum + same-FR tickets/tracker/DAG for larger changes — **`.cursor/skills/expand-feature/SKILL.md`**. |
| Parallel handoff for **tickets** (`T-FR-NNNN-xx`) | `identify-frontier` / `/identify-frontier` | Recomputes who can run in parallel from **`tasks/feature-history/**/tickets.md`** + **`ticket-progress.md`** (DAG hints in **`tickets-initial.md`**). |
| Implement parallel set | `develop-frontier` / `/develop-frontier` | One child worktree per ticket under **`.worktrees/FR-NNNN-<slug>/`**; **TEST→DEV→VAL** per ticket. |
| Merge tickets → feature branch → PR | `finish-feature` / `/finish-feature` | Merges feature-prefixed ticket/stage branches into **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`**, validates, **PR to `main`** for human review; **never** auto-deletes remote branches. |
| Merge to `main` (integration) | `finish-frontier` / `/finish-frontier` | Direct integration of parallel ticket/stage branches into **`main`** when not using the feature-branch line. |
| Commits (optional) | `commit-with-ai-metrics` / `/commit-with-metrics` | Conventional commit + optional metrics footer. |
| Doc site (MkDocs) — preview / static build | **`./develop`** (`./develop help`) | When **`docs/`** or **`mkdocs.yml`** change: use **`./develop up`** (Docker Compose, bind-mounted repo, live reload) or **`./develop local`** (host venv via **`./scripts/serve-docs.sh`**). Run **`./develop build`** for a containerized static build before closeout or as doc **VAL** when tickets touch docs. Set **`DEVELOP_*`** in optional **`develop.conf`** (from **`develop.conf.example`**) if service names or ports differ. **Aligns** with **Docker for VAL** in **`docs/ai-context.md`**. |

**Naming disambiguation:** The words **“identify”** in *identify, prompt, develop* refer to **FR intake + registering `FR-NNNN`**, not to **`/identify-frontier`**. Use **`/identify-frontier`** only **after** tickets exist in the tracker and you want a **parallel work** handoff.

### Human-readable names vs ticket ids (user-facing text)

**Stable ids** (`T-FR-NNNN-xx`, branch names, **`ticket-progress.md`**) stay as-is for tools and git. In **anything a human reads first** — prompts to the user, **`serial-diary.md`** / **`handoffs/`** recaps, **`README.md`** bullets, **`90-closeout.md`** narrative, global **`tasks/handoffs/`** pointers — use this order:

1. **Lead with the ticket title** (the **Title:** field in **`tickets.md`**, or the short phrase after **`—`** in the **`### T-FR-NNNN-xx — …`** heading). That is the primary name.
2. **Then** the ticket id, ideally as a **markdown link** to the canonical section so readers can open details:
   `[T-FR-NNNN-xx](tasks/feature-history/FR-NNNN-<slug>/tickets.md#…)`
   Use the heading anchor your host generates (GitHub/GitLab slugify the full **`###`** line; if the fragment is uncertain, link to **`tickets.md`** without a fragment and name the ticket id once in the same sentence).
3. **Mermaid DAGs** in **`20-tickets-dag.md`** / **`tickets-initial.md`:** label nodes with **title first**, id second (e.g. `T01["Scaffold Electron shell (T-FR-0002-02)"]`) so graphs stay scannable; keep **Deps** as real ids.

**Filenames** under **`parallel/`** may stay id-prefixed for uniqueness (`parallel/T-FR-0002-02-electron-shell.md`) or use a short title slug plus id; do not drop the id from machine-oriented paths if ambiguity would break parallel streams.

**Template note:** Keep **`.cursor/skills/`** and **`.claude/commands/`** aligned when you change this workflow — follow **`.cursor/rules/cursor-claude-doc-sync.mdc`**.

**Context:** For **large** `FR-NNNN` efforts (many subsystems, big ticket DAG, wide codebase impact), **spawn subagents early** for discovery or per-area design drafts, then consolidate into **`serial-diary.md`** or **`parallel/*.md`** per **`docs/ai-context.md` §1b**.

### Local dev: `./develop` and Docker (when this repo has MkDocs / Compose)

- **`./develop` is the supported entrypoint** (not a parallel to **`/identify-frontier`**) for running the **documentation** stack: **`help`**, **`up`**, **`down`**, **`build`**, **`local`**, shell/run helpers. See the root **`README.md`**.
- **Development commands default to containers:** when a repo ships **`./develop`**, Compose, a Dev Container, or CI image, run build/test/lint/package-manager/doc/dev-server commands through that container path where possible. Host-local commands are exceptions and must be recorded in the stage diary or handoff.
- **Web UI validation is required for web UI tickets:** during implementation and **VAL**, any ticket that creates or changes user-visible web UI must include **`docs/ai-context.md` → Web UI validation**: scripted frontend checks plus rendered browser inspection. Use the project overlay or stack conventions for commands, local URL, browser-capable tool, and route/state matrix; document host-local or browser-tool exceptions.
- **During design (Stages 1..N):** if the feature adds or rewrites **design or product docs** under **`docs/`**, run **`./develop up`** or **`./develop local`** to verify navigation, links, Mermaid, and formatting before you treat a design stage as done.
- **During implementation and VAL:** if a **ticket** changes **`docs/`** or site config, include **`./develop build`** (or the ticket’s own Docker-based doc check) in **VAL** or note the equivalent verification in **`parallel/…` / `tickets.md`** so **`docs/ai-context.md`** (Docker for verification) is satisfied. If the project has no **`./develop`** or Compose yet, use **`/develop-frontier`**-assigned worktrees and document **VAL** criteria per ticket.

---

## Registry: `FR-NNNN` (stable id)

- Open **`tasks/feature-history/REGISTRY.md`**. Assign the next **`FR-NNNN`** (four digits, monotonic, **never reuse** a number for a different feature). Increment **`next_id`**.
- **Deconflict parallel features:** As soon as the id is written (and the minimal folder stub exists — see Stage 0), **`git pull`** then **`commit` + `push` to `origin/main`** for that change. Other streams rely on **`main`** to see reserved numbers and avoid duplicate **`FR-NNNN`** / **`next_id`** collisions. If push fails, **pull/rebase or merge**, fix conflicts in **`REGISTRY.md`** manually, then push again before assuming the id is yours.
- **Link** to implementation tickets: `FR-0007` may map to **`T-FR-0007-01`**, **`T-FR-0007-02`**, …; keep that mapping in the feature directory and the closeout handoff.
- **Parallel features:** **`REGISTRY.md`** may list **several** features in **`design`** or **`in-progress`** at once. Each feature’s artifacts stay under its own **`FR-NNNN-<slug>/`** directory so parallel design agents do not share one diary file unless intentionally serial.

---

## Parallel features vs one frontier batch

- **`FR-NNNN`** tracks **design and history** per product feature.
- **`/identify-frontier`** / **`/develop-frontier`** operate on the **single global** ticket graph (**`T-FR-NNNN-xx`**) whose **definitions** live in **`tasks/feature-history/**/tickets.md`**, with **`docs/design/tickets-initial.md`** holding the **combined DAG** only. A parallel-capable batch may therefore include tickets from **Feature A and Feature B** in the same wave if **Deps** allow — see **`docs/ai-context.md` §2c**.
- When landing tickets from **`20-tickets-dag.md`**, ensure **Deps** across the whole graph stay acyclic; avoid accidental **cross-feature cycles** unless intentional.

---

## Directory layout (required)

For feature **`FR-NNNN`**, with short slug `<slug>` (kebab-case):

```text
tasks/feature-history/FR-NNNN-<slug>/
  README.md                 # one-screen index; update as stages complete
  00-intake.md              # goals, timeline, raw request
  10-design-00-skeleton.md  # L0: interfaces and boundaries only
  10-design-01-*.md         # L1+ deepening (add files as needed)
  20-tickets-dag.md         # draft: Jira/Asana-ready table + mermaid + file mapping (promote into tickets.md)
  tickets.md                # **canonical** `### T-FR-NNNN-xx` sections + phases + Deps for this FR only
  serial-diary.md           # one append-only file for **serial** agents (or human run)
  parallel/                 # one diary file per **parallel** agent stream
  handoffs/                 # **primary** continue / milestone / finish notes for this feature (dated `*.md`)
  DIARY.md                  # merged **stack** diary (newest entries at top); see **Diary consolidation** below
  90-closeout.md            # final synopsis + **links to every artifact** in this folder
```

- **Serial runs:** append stages to **`serial-diary.md`** (and/or per-stage files). One narrative chain.
- **Parallel design or implementation subagents:** each stream writes **`parallel/<stream>.md`** (e.g. `parallel/T-FR-0007-01-scaffold-api.md` — include a **title slug** from the ticket so folder listings stay human-readable). Do **not** overwrite **`serial-diary.md`** from parallel streams.
- **Continue / resume handoffs:** write under **`handoffs/`** (e.g. **`handoffs/2026-04-25-continue.md`**) — this is the **canonical** place for “what the next agent should do” **for this `FR-NNNN`**. A short pointer in **`tasks/handoffs/`** is optional, not a substitute.
- **Git (implementation):** create **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`** from the default branch when starting build-out and check it out at **`.worktrees/FR-NNNN-<slug>/feature/`**. Create every ticket/stage branch from that feature branch, name it with both feature and ticket/stage (for example **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>/T-FR-NNNN-xx-short-name`**), place its worktree under **`.worktrees/FR-NNNN-<slug>/<ticket-or-stage-slug>/`**, merge it **into** the feature branch as tickets complete, and keep all product code on **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`** until **`docs/ai-context.md` §2d** **feature-complete gate** is met. Only then run **`/finish-feature`** to open the **PR to the default branch** for human review. Maintain repo-root **`CURRENT.md`** on those **`feat/*`** branches per **Branch state (`CURRENT.md`)** below.

If you need a one-off “prompt log”, add `prompts/prompts-log.md` and link it from the README.

### Diary consolidation (`DIARY.md`)

At meaningful milestones or **closeout**:

1. **Read** `serial-diary.md` and every **`parallel/*.md`** (newest activity first if you can infer timestamps from git or file order).
2. **Write** **`DIARY.md`** as a **single merged log** with **most recent entry at the top** (stack order). Each block must include: **date**, **source path** (`serial-diary.md` / `parallel/foo.md`), optional **branch or SHA**, and the **body** of the recap (keep enough context for audit).
3. **Preserve** `serial-diary.md` and **`parallel/`** unchanged as the append-only originals — **`DIARY.md`** is an additional merged view for humans and git archaeology, not a replacement that deletes history.
4. **Commit** `DIARY.md` (and handoffs) on the same feature or integration branch so the merge history stays linked.

---

## Branch state (`CURRENT.md`)

**Repo-root** **`CURRENT.md`** answers: *on **this git branch**, what is true right now, and what happens next?* It complements **`tasks/feature-history/FR-NNNN-<slug>/`** (deep history) with a **branch-local** beacon at the checkout root.

### When the file exists

| Situation | Policy |
|-----------|--------|
| **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`** (feature integration branch) | **Required** once the branch exists: add **`CURRENT.md`** on the first meaningful commit (template in **`reference-templates.md` → Branch state**). **Keep it updated** through merges, identify/develop cycles, and blockers until the **PR to `main`** is merged or abandoned. |
| **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>/T-…`** (ticket/stage branches) | **Required:** each ticket branch carries **`CURRENT.md`** scoped to that ticket; refresh after **TEST / DEV / VAL** transitions and before pushing or opening PRs **into the feature branch**. |
| **`main`** (intake / design / registry only) | **Do not** use a long-lived repo-root **`CURRENT.md`** for per-feature state when **several** **`FR-NNNN`** streams may touch **`main`** in parallel (one file would collide). Use **`tasks/feature-history/FR-NNNN-<slug>/README.md`** and **`handoffs/`** until **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`** exists. A single-stream team *may* add a short root pointer—prefer updating the feature **`README.md`**. |
| **`main`** after feature or frontier integration | **Delete** **`CURRENT.md`** in the merge to **`main`** (or in the next commit) so **`main`** does not keep stale branch-local prose, unless the repo documents a repo-wide **`CURRENT.md`** convention. |

### What to write (keep it short)

- **`FR-NNNN`**, **`<slug>`**, **this branch name** and role (feature integration vs ticket).
- **What landed** on this branch (ticket ids optional), **what is in flight**, **blockers**.
- **Next action** (command or human step), links to **`tasks/ticket-progress.md`**, **`tasks/feature-history/FR-NNNN-<slug>/handoffs/`**, and **`tickets.md`**.

### When to refresh (minimum)

- First commit on **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`**; creating each ticket branch; after every **merge** into the feature branch (on **`CURRENT.md`** conflicts, **consolidate** one truthful rollup on **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`**).
- After **`/identify-frontier`** changes the parallel set — orchestrator updates **`CURRENT.md`** on each affected **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`** when implementation is in scope.
- End of each **TEST / DEV / VAL** phase on a ticket branch; before **`/finish-feature`** push and PR; on **block** / **unblock**; when resuming implementation via **`/feature-request-continue`**.

### Rollup vs ticket scope

The **feature** branch **`CURRENT.md`** is the **integrated** picture after ticket merges. Each **ticket** branch file may stay narrower until merge; the merger updates the feature branch file.

---

## `/feature-request-continue` and integration PR hygiene

When **`README.md`**, **`90-closeout.md`**, newest **`handoffs/*.md`**, or **`tasks/ticket-progress.md` → Current focus** still instruct merging an integration PR or “awaiting merge” for the **`FR-NNNN`** under review:

1. **`git fetch`** for **`origin`** (or the team’s canonical remote).
2. **Verify merge state on the remote default branch** (`main`, `master`, or project convention — use **`docs/ai-context.md`**, **`git remote show origin`**, or **`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`** when unsure) **before** recommending merge in the user-facing close. **Do not** tell the human to merge if the PR is already merged.
   - Examples: **`gh pr view <n> --json state,mergedAt`** (GitHub CLI); or **`git log origin/<default> --oneline --grep 'Merge pull request'`** / confirm the feature tip is an ancestor of **`origin/<default>`** after fetch.
3. **If already merged:** **`git pull`** the local default branch; set the feature row to **`complete`** in **`tasks/feature-history/REGISTRY.md`**; remove repo-root **`CURRENT.md`** on the default branch if it still exists; refresh **`tasks/ticket-progress.md` → Current focus**; update the feature **`README.md`** and **`90-closeout.md`** so the PR reads as merged, not blocking.
4. **Post-merge closeout (standard):** When **`REGISTRY.md`** shows **`complete`** for this **`FR-NNNN`**, ensure **`tasks/feature-history/FR-NNNN-<slug>/90-closeout.md`** exists (or write it now) with **Executive summary**, artifact links, PR link, ticket title mapping, **Suggested next step**, and **Options** — same contract as **Stage — Closeout, handoff, and index**. **Retire `Parallel streams`:** remove the row for this **`FR-NNNN`** from **`tasks/ticket-progress.md`** (or replace with a one-line **complete** pointer to **`90-closeout.md`** / **`REGISTRY.md`** only if the team wants an audit stub — do **not** leave active branch/worktree language for a closed feature).
5. **If still open:** merge + review remains a valid suggested next step; state that verification showed the PR **open** so the handoff is trustworthy.

**Slash command text:** **`.claude/commands/feature-request-continue.md`** repeats the fetch + verify step at the top of the step list so orchestrators run it before reading stale merge instructions.

---

## Stage 0 — Intake

1. Allocate **`FR-NNNN`** in **`REGISTRY.md`**; create the directory tree; add **`README.md`** stub. **Immediately** commit and **push to `main`** (registry + stub) so concurrent feature work can deconflict on the shared **`REGISTRY.md`**.
2. Fill **`00-intake.md`** from **`reference-templates.md`** (title, timeline, success criteria, out of scope, raw prose).
3. Append **`serial-diary.md`**: one paragraph recap of intake.
4. **Branch state:** while work stays on **`main`** for intake, follow **`CURRENT.md`** policy (**do not** add a per-feature competing root file unless the single-stream exception in **Branch state (`CURRENT.md`)** applies); keep **`README.md`** in the feature folder current.

**Stop and ask** only if the request is empty or success criteria are impossible to state.

---

## Stages 1..N — Design (skeleton first, then deepen)

1. **L0 — Skeleton (`10-design-00-skeleton.md`):** public surfaces only: APIs, types, events, data contracts. **No** implementation, **no** internal class diagrams unless they are the public API. Use tables from **`reference-templates.md`**.
2. **L1+:** Add more files or sections **only as needed** (complexity, risk, number of subsystems, regulatory/security, scale):
   - small feature: L0 + short risks may suffice;
   - large feature: sequence diagrams, data lifecycle, idempotency, error taxonomy, SLO/throughput.
3. Each stage ends with a **plain-English summary** in **`serial-diary.md`** (or the relevant **`parallel/…`** file).
4. If the stage touched **`docs/`**, use **`./develop up`** or **`./develop local`** to preview where **`./develop`** is available; note any build warnings in the diary.
5. **User-visible UI:** before treating a design stage as done for screens, flows, or shell layout, add or update **static HTML mocks** under **`docs/design/mockups/`** and link them from the authoritative **`docs/design/…`** doc. For additions to an existing UI, update the current UI as the example when possible so the proposed change is shown in real context. Mocks are the visual source of truth until amended — **`.cursor/rules/ui-design-mockups.mdc`**. Do not author UI-leaning **`T-FR-NNNN-xx`** DEV tickets without mocks (unless the user documented an explicit waiver in intake/diary).
6. **Actor-driven seed data / E2E:** when the feature creates or changes seeded users, personas, role fixtures, E2E actors, stakeholders, antagonists, guiding figures, or outside-force actors, add or update the actor-profile design doc under **`docs/design/`** (recommended **`docs/design/seed-actor-profiles.md`**) before ticketing implementation. Each profile needs seed anchors, story keys, UI/backend/time/test traceability, security boundaries, and growth-dream candidates. Cross-actor effects need a story relationship graph and handler story edges per **`docs/design/actor-driven-development.md`**; non-trivial systems should also maintain the app-readable **`docs/design/actors/`** graph and use **`docs/design/profile-server-app.md`** when planning a generic profile viewer.

Tag unknowns with **`DESIGN-GAP`** per **`docs/ai-context.md`**.

---

## Stage — Tickets, DAG, mapping to the repo tracker

### Plain-English ticket writing (required)

Tickets are read cold by humans and by agents with no prior chat context. Write them so a skilled outsider can understand **what** and **why** in under a minute, then drill into testable detail.

**Required fields** on every new or not-yet-started **`### T-FR-NNNN-xx`** body (see **`reference-templates.md` → Canonical ticket body**):

| Field | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Title** | Short verb-led name (human-facing everywhere). |
| **In plain English** | 2–4 short sentences: who/what this helps, what changes in the product or system, what “done” looks like. Everyday words first; if a term is unavoidable, define it once in the same block. |
| **Why this exists** | One sentence: unlocks a dependency, closes a user gap, or removes a risk. |
| **Out of scope** | One line or short bullets — what this ticket deliberately does **not** do. |
| **Done when (plain English)** | 3–7 observable outcomes a non-expert can check. |
| **Acceptance criteria** | Keep precise/testable bullets for implementers (may stay technical). |
| **Primary files** / **Phases** | Unchanged — ownership and TEST→DEV→VAL. |

**Style rules:**

- Prefer “scientist sees exact candidate counts before the scan starts” over “authoritative per-target/aggregate scan plans.”
- A bit of context is good; fog is not. Do not pad with process jargon.
- **`20-tickets-dag.md` Summary of change** column: same plain-English bar (1–2 sentences a cold reader understands).
- **Do not rewrite** tickets that already have any phase **`done`** or **`in progress`** unless the user explicitly asks. Historical tickets stay as shipped. Apply this style to **new** tickets and to **not-yet-started** tickets (all phases still `—` / empty) when refreshing a live feature.

1. Author **`20-tickets-dag.md`** (draft / planning):
   - Table: ticket id (**`T-FR-NNNN-xx`**), **title** (required; this is the human-facing name everywhere below), type, **deps** (other full ticket ids or `none`), **plain-English** one- or two-line **summary of change**, optional **order group** (P0, P1). Optional **Link** column: relative URL to **`tickets.md#…`** after sections exist, or “promote first”.
   - **Mermaid** `flowchart` or `graph` DAG with **edges = dependency** (A must be VAL-done before B starts if `A --> B`). **Node labels:** readable title + id in parentheses (see **Human-readable names vs ticket ids** above); dependency arrows still reference node ids you define.
   - **Maximize parallel width:** split by module boundary and shared files; use shared “facade + interfaces” tickets to unblock parallel work (same spirit as `identify-frontier` eligibility).
2. **Promote to canonical feature tickets** — in **`tasks/feature-history/FR-NNNN-<slug>/tickets.md`**:
   - Add every **`### T-FR-NNNN-xx`** section with the **plain-English fields** above, **Deps:**, and **Phases** tables (this file is the **source of truth** for that feature’s ticket bodies).
3. **Register and graph:**
   - Add a row for this feature to **`tasks/feature-history/TICKET-SOURCES.md`** if not already listed.
   - Extend **`docs/design/tickets-initial.md`**: add the feature row to **Per-feature ticket files**, and extend the **global mermaid** (and any cross-feature edges) so the published DAG matches all **Deps:**.
4. **Progress:** add or update rows in **`tasks/ticket-progress.md`** for each new ticket id.
5. Append **`serial-diary`**: what was split, what was intentionally serialized, and **why**.

If the user forbids direct repo edits, keep a “Proposed patch” section under **`20-tickets-dag.md`** instead, but the **target** layout above is still the contract.

---

## Stage — Prompt: develop or not?

1. Present a short **summary** of the design and ticket count. List tickets as **title + linked id** (per **Human-readable names vs ticket ids**), not ids alone.
2. **Ask the user:** “Do you want to start implementation now (parallel frontier) or stop after design?”
3. If **no** → finalize **`90-closeout.md`**, handoff, done (design-only delivery).
4. If **yes** → continue to **develop**.
5. **User-facing close** — end with **Executive summary**, **Suggested next step**, and **Options** (implement vs design-only is an options case) per **User-facing close (required)** above.

---

## Stage — Develop (identify → develop)

**Precondition:** Every ticket in the DAG that you intend to work exists in **`tasks/feature-history/**/tickets.md`** (canonical **`###`** sections) and **`ticket-progress.md`**. `develop-frontier` **will not** invent tickets.

1. **Optional but recommended:** Run **`/identify-frontier`** (or the skill) to write **`tasks/handoffs/…-parallel-frontier.md`** (global queue). Also append a **feature-scoped** summary under **`handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD-identify-note.md`** in **this** `FR-NNNN` folder so the next worker reads one place.
2. Update **`tasks/ticket-progress.md` → Current focus** per **`develop-frontier`**: `Session status` = `developing`, list worktrees and ticket ids.
3. Run **`/develop-frontier`** (or the skill) to launch **one subagent per parallel-capable ticket**, each in a child worktree under **`.worktrees/FR-NNNN-<slug>/`** on a feature-prefixed ticket/stage branch, **TEST→DEV→VAL** in order **inside** each ticket.
4. For each parallel subagent, ensure **`parallel/…-diary.md`** gets an entry when that stream starts and when it ends.
5. Run development-specific commands for each ticket (**build**, **test**, **lint**, **format**, package-manager scripts, doc builds, and dev servers) inside Docker / Docker Compose / Dev Container / CI images where possible; record host-local exceptions in the ticket diary or handoff.
6. When a ticket or stream creates or changes user-visible web UI, include required **Web UI validation** from **`docs/ai-context.md`** before marking **VAL** `done`: scripted frontend checks plus rendered browser inspection using the project’s documented commands, local URL, browser-capable tool, and route/state matrix.
7. When a ticket or stream edits **`docs/`** and the project ships **`./develop`**: prefer **`./develop build`** (or **`./develop up`** to manually verify) for doc **VAL** in line with **`docs/ai-context.md`** (run verification in **Docker** / **Dev Container** for consistency).
8. **CURRENT.md:** on **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`** and each **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>/T-…`** ticket branch, create or refresh repo-root **`CURRENT.md`** per **Branch state (`CURRENT.md`)** after phase changes and merges.

---

## Stage — Prompt: continue?

After each develop chunk or when the user returns:

- If the checkout is on **`feat/*`**, read repo-root **`CURRENT.md`** first, then **`handoffs/`** and **`serial-diary.md`**.
- **Ask:** “Continue with the next work (**title**, linked ticket) / another parallel batch, or pause?” — name **titles** from **`tickets.md`**, link ids for detail.
- If the queue or deps changed, re-run **`/identify-frontier`**.
- **User-facing close** — end with **Executive summary**, **Suggested next step**, and **Options** when the user can reasonably choose paths (per **User-facing close (required)**).

---

## Stage — Finish implementation (prompt, then run)

1. **Ask:** “All **`### T-FR-NNNN-xx`** tickets in **`tickets.md`** for this **`FR-NNNN`** are VAL-done on **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`** (see **`docs/ai-context.md` §2d** gate). Merge via **`/finish-feature`** (open PR from **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`** to the default branch) or **`/finish-frontier`** (direct default-branch integration)?”
2. **Default for `FR-NNNN` product work:** run **`/finish-feature`** **only after** the **feature-complete gate** — merges any remaining ticket/stage branches into **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`**, validates, opens **PR** for human review. **Do not** push the default branch from automation here. **Do not** open that PR before every ticket in **`tickets.md`** is VAL **`done`** unless a **documented exception** applies (**§2d**).
3. **Alternate:** **`/finish-frontier`** when the team explicitly integrates parallel tickets straight into **`main`**. Follow that skill’s **revalidation** / **`broken-main`** gate.
4. **CURRENT.md:** before **`/finish-feature`**, ensure **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`**’s **`CURRENT.md`** reflects all merged tickets. The **PR to `main`** (or the human merge) should **remove** **`CURRENT.md`** on **`main`** per **Branch state (`CURRENT.md`)**.
5. After merge: run **Diary consolidation** → update **`DIARY.md`** (newest-first stack); **do not delete** remote **`feat/*`** branches.

---

## Stage — Closeout, handoff, and index

1. Write **`90-closeout.md`**:
   - **Executive summary** (what shipped vs deferred, in plain language);
   - **Links to all files** in `FR-NNNN-<slug>/` (including **`handoffs/`** and **`DIARY.md`**);
   - If implementation ran: one line on repo-root **`CURRENT.md`** (maintained on **`feat/*`**; removed on **`main`** when merged) per **Branch state (`CURRENT.md`)**;
   - **Mapping** `FR-NNNN` → tickets: for each **`T-FR-NNNN-xx`**, give **title** and a **link** to its **`###`** section in **`tickets.md`** (not ids-only bullets); **PR** link if **`finish-feature`** ran;
   - **Suggested next step** for the team (one primary);
   - **Options** for follow-up work (new tickets, `DESIGN-GAP` items, or alternative owners) when more than one path exists; otherwise state there is a single obvious follow-up or none.
2. Write **`handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD-closeout.md`** in **this feature folder** with the same anchor content (primary handoff). Optionally add **`tasks/handoffs/FR-NNNN-<slug>-closeout.md`** as a **short pointer** (“see feature `handoffs/…`”) — never let the global file replace the feature-local handoff.
3. Final **Diary consolidation:** ensure **`DIARY.md`** exists with **newest-first** merged entries from **`serial-diary.md`** + **`parallel/`**; commit on a surviving branch for traceability.
4. Update **`REGISTRY.md`**: set status **complete** (or `design-only`, `in-progress` as appropriate).
5. If project rules or commands were updated as part of the feature, list them in **`90-closeout.md`**.
6. **`tasks/ticket-progress.md` (shared tracker):** Remove this **`FR-NNNN`** from **`Parallel streams`** when status is **`complete`** (do not list closed features as active parallel work). If **Current focus** still names a ticket from this closed **`FR-NNNN`**, move **Current focus** to the **next** incomplete ticket (smallest eligible **`T-…`** per **`tickets.md`** **Deps:**) unless the human intentionally keeps a completed row for audit only — in that case, state so in **`serial-diary.md`** or **`handoffs/`** so **`/feature-request-continue`** does not mis-route.

## When to update `.cursor` / `.claude` / `docs/ai-context.md`

If the feature request **introduces a new process or renames a command**, update **both**:

- **Cursor:** `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/skills/`
- **Claude:** `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/rules/`

per **`.cursor/rules/cursor-claude-doc-sync.mdc`**. Otherwise, **no** doc churn.

---

## Quality checks (before handoff)

- [ ] `FR-NNNN` appears in `REGISTRY.md` (reservation **pushed to `main`** before heavy parallel work) and in **`handoffs/…-closeout.md`** inside the feature folder (optional pointer in `tasks/handoffs/` only).
- [ ] **`DIARY.md`** updated with newest-first merged diary when work had parallel streams or long serial history.
- [ ] `20-tickets-dag.md` / **`tickets.md`** DAG has no cycles; every edge matches **`Deps:`** in **`tickets.md`** and the global mermaid in **`docs/design/tickets-initial.md`** (when present).
- [ ] `serial-diary` (and `parallel/…` if used) have a recap per stage.
- [ ] `90-closeout.md` links to **every** artifact in the feature folder.
- [ ] If implementation ran: `develop-frontier` preconditions were satisfied; **`finish-feature`** or **`finish-frontier`** was chosen consistently with **§2d**; **VAL** per **`docs/ai-context.md`** (Docker / Dev Container). **Doc changes:** if **`docs/`** or **`mkdocs.yml`** changed, doc **VAL** used **`./develop build`** or equivalent Docker-based check when **`./develop`** exists.
- [ ] If **`REGISTRY.md`** status is **`complete`** for this **`FR-NNNN`**: **`90-closeout.md`** exists in **`tasks/feature-history/FR-NNNN-<slug>/`**; **`tasks/ticket-progress.md` → Parallel streams** does **not** list this feature as an active stream (retire the row per **Closeout** step 6); **Current focus** targets a **non-complete** ticket unless explicitly documented otherwise.
- [ ] If multiple streams are **still active** (incomplete **VAL** on at least one listed ticket): **`tasks/ticket-progress.md` → Parallel streams`** (or a dated **`tasks/handoffs/`** note) lists each ticket (**title** + **`T-FR-NNNN-xx`** + link to **`tickets.md`** where helpful), **`FR-NNNN`** (if any), and worktree path per **`docs/ai-context.md` §2c**.
- [ ] **CURRENT.md:** every active **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>`** and **`feat/FR-NNNN-<slug>/T-…`** implementation branch has an accurate repo-root **`CURRENT.md`** (see **Branch state (`CURRENT.md`)**); after integration to **`main`**, **`CURRENT.md`** is removed or neutralized per policy.
- [ ] **User-facing close:** the last user-visible reply for the chunk (and matching **`handoffs/`** or **`90-closeout.md`**) includes **Executive summary**, **Suggested next step**, and **Options** when several paths are reasonable (**User-facing close (required)**).

## Known process tensions (surface to the user if unclear)

1. **Tickets must exist** before `develop-frontier` / `identify-frontier` can act — the FR workflow is responsible for **landing** or **stating** merge-ready **`tickets.md`** + **`ticket-progress.md`** (+ DAG rows in **`tickets-initial.md`**).
2. **`FR-NNNN`** is the **feature** id; **`T-FR-NNNN-xx`** is the **implementation ticket** id (ticket embeds feature); link any cross-feature tickets explicitly in closeout.
3. **Registry races:** mitigated by **pushing the registry reservation to `main` immediately** after allocating **`FR-NNNN`**; if two streams still collide, **`git pull`** and resolve **`REGISTRY.md`** manually (re-number or merge rows), then push again.
4. **“Identify”** in the spoken workflow means **FR registry + intake**, not the **`/identify-frontier`** command until tickets exist.
5. **Parallel features:** several **`FR-NNNN`** may be in **`design` / `in-progress`** at once — use **separate** feature directories and **`parallel/`** diaries; do not append unrelated features to one **`serial-diary.md`**. Shared tracker files still need **one-writer discipline** or explicit merge order (**`docs/ai-context.md` §2c**).
6. **Two-layer tickets:** **`tickets.md`** owns **`###`** bodies; **`docs/design/tickets-initial.md`** owns the **global mermaid** — keep **Deps:** and graph edges in sync when either changes.
7. **Git audit:** feature and ticket **`feat/*`** branches must remain on the remote unless a **human** explicitly deletes them after review.
